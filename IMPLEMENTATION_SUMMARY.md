# Implementation Summary: Enhanced Data Presentation with Graphs and Editable Lectures

## Features Added

### 1. Data Visualization (Graphs)
- Added bar chart visualizations for:
  - Lectures by Department
  - Lecture Types (Lecture vs Exercise)
  - Course Requirements (Obligatory vs Elective)
  - Lecture Durations

### 2. Editable Lecture Table
- Inline editing of lecture data directly in the table
- Form inputs for all lecture fields:
  - Lecture Name
  - Department
  - Semester
  - Level
  - Year
  - Professor
  - Group
  - Type (Lecture/Exercise)
  - Requirement (Obligatory/Elective)
  - Instructor (Professor/Assistant)
  - Duration
- Save and Cancel functionality for edits
- Automatic synchronization with backend database

### 3. Backend API Enhancements
- Added PUT endpoint for updating lectures: `/api/lectures/{lecture_id}`
- Added DELETE endpoint for removing lectures: `/api/lectures/{lecture_id}`

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `schedule-builder/frontend/src/App.js`:
  - Enhanced DataPresentationTab component with graphing capabilities
  - Implemented editable lecture table with inline editing
  - Added state management for editing operations
  - Added graph rendering functions

- `schedule-builder/frontend/src/App.css`:
  - Added custom CSS styles for graph visualization
  - Improved table responsiveness

### Backend
- `schedule-builder/backend/app/main.py`:
  - Added update_lecture endpoint (PUT /api/lectures/{lecture_id})
  - Added delete_lecture endpoint (DELETE /api/lectures/{lecture_id})
  - Fixed import statements and type hints

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Graph Visualization**:
   - Created `renderGraph` function to generate bar charts
   - Implemented `generateGraphs` function to process data for visualization
   - Added responsive graph container with CSS styling

2. **Editable Table**:
   - Added state variables for tracking editing mode (`editingLecture`, `editForm`)
   - Implemented `startEditing`, `cancelEditing`, and `saveEdit` functions
   - Created form inputs with proper validation and data binding
   - Added save functionality that calls the backend API

3. **API Integration**:
   - Modified fetch calls to use the correct port (8003)
   - Added PUT request for saving lecture updates
   - Implemented error handling for API calls

### Backend Implementation
1. **Update Endpoint**:
   - PUT `/api/lectures/{lecture_id}` endpoint
   - Updates lecture in both database and in-memory storage
   - Returns success message and updated lecture data

2. **Delete Endpoint**:
   - DELETE `/api/lectures/{lecture_id}` endpoint
   - Removes lecture from both database and in-memory storage
   - Returns success message

## Usage Instructions

1. **Viewing Graphs**:
   - Navigate to the "Data Presentation" tab after uploading data
   - Graphs will automatically display at the top of the page

2. **Editing Lectures**:
   - Click the "Edit" button next to any lecture row
   - Modify the lecture data in the form fields
   - Click "Save" to update the lecture or "Cancel" to discard changes
   - Changes are automatically saved to the database

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- Graph rendering with sample data
- Editing functionality with form validation
- API integration for saving updates
- Responsive design on different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more graph types (pie charts, line graphs)
2. Implement bulk editing capabilities
3. Add filtering and sorting options for the lecture table
4. Enhance error handling and user feedback
5. Add real-time updates using WebSockets
